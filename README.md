# Babys Breath Babywearing Library — Waitlist

Static one-page waitlist site for a babywearing carrier library in the Willamette Valley, OR.

## One-click deploy (Vercel)

1. Push this folder to a Git repo.
2. In Vercel, click **New Project** and import the repo.
3. Framework preset: **Other** (no build command).
4. Output directory: `.` (project root).

Once deployed, set the custom domain to `library.babysbreathbw.com`.

## Supabase setup

Create a Supabase project, then run this SQL in the SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.waitlist (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  email text not null unique,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.waitlist enable row level security;
```

Connect Supabase to your Vercel project (Marketplace integration) so these env vars are added:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

The waitlist form posts to `/api/waitlist`, which writes to Supabase using the service role key.

## Email form

Signups are stored in Supabase. (Email notifications can be added later if needed.)

## Local preview

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or use a static server.
